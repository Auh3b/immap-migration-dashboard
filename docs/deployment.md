# Steps for Netlify Deployment

Netlify is a popular platform for deploying and hosting web applications, providing a streamlined and automated deployment process. Below, I'll outline the basic steps for deploying a website to Netlify and provide some links to official documentation for more detailed information.

1. **Create a Netlify Account:**
   If you don't already have a Netlify account, sign up for one at [Netlify's website](https://app.netlify.com/signup).

2. **Connect Your Repository to Netlify:**
   Go to the Netlify dashboard and click on "New site from Git." Connect your Git repository and configure your build settings.

3. **Configure Build Settings:**
   Netlify will automatically detect many popular frameworks, but you might need to specify build commands and output directories in the dashboard if your project is not auto-detected.

   - **Environmental Variables**
     You need required environmental variables:

     | Name                         | Variable                                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

4. **Deploy Your Site:**
   Once your repository is connected, Netlify will automatically trigger a build and deploy your site. You can monitor the build process in the Netlify dashboard.

5. **Custom Domain (Optional):**
   If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in the "Domain settings" section of the Netlify dashboard.
